# Exact Hidden Markov Models

The aim of this repository is to merge several methods into one library to allow the user to establish the dynamics followed and to make predictions on a time series that does not
follow usual dynamics. 

The first package **RF-HMM** provide a way using [hmmlearn](https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn) and a boost using random-forest to reach parameters that describe in the best way the dynamic of your time series.
